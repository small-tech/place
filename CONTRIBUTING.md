Place is [Small Technology](https://ar.al/2019/03/04/small-technology/). The emphasis is on _small_. It is, by design, a zero-configuration tool for creating and hosting single-tenant web applications. It is for humans, by humans. It is non-commercial. (It is not for enterprises, it is not for “startups”, and it is definitely not for unicorns.) As such, any new feature requests will have to be both fit for purpose and survive a trial by fire to be considered.

Please file issues and submit pull requests on the [Place Github Mirror](https://github.com/small-tech/place).
