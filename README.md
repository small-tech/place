Place is a hard fork of [Site.js](https://sitejs.org).

The goal of Site.js was to create a server that could run all our current sites at [Small Technology Foundation](https://small-tech.org) and to thus create a solid base of a self-updating, zero-maintenance, single-tenant web server.

Place jettisons some of the generic web-related functionality (e.g., static site generation via Hugo, etc.) in Site.js and reimagines other features (routing, data exchange, workflows, etc.) to implement a tool specifically for [Small Web](https://small-tech.org/research-and-development) development.

Place is under rapid development with constant breaking changes and is not ready for production use.
